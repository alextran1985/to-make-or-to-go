### PROJECT TITLE: 
```To Make or To Go```

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Eating meals are an essential part of our daily lives. The problem we are always faced with though, is, "What to eat?". 
With "TO MAKE OR TO GO", we aim to make it more convenient for you to tackle this daily struggle.  
Users are prompted to decide whether they want TO MAKE their meal or TO GO to a restaurant. Upon deciding, the user will be prompted to input their preferences depending on their choice of TO MAKE or TO GO (e.g. ingredients to include, location of restaurant). Once the user clicks on search, they will be provided with results to help them decide on a recipe TO MAKE or a restaurant TO GO to.
